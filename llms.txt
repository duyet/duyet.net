# duyet.net

Simple redirect application built with Deno. It redirects various slugs to their corresponding URLs.

The application maps predefined slugs to specific URLs and performs HTTP 301 redirects with analytics tracking using ClickHouse database.

## Key Features

- URL shortening and redirection service
- Real-time analytics tracking with ClickHouse
- Mini PC monitoring dashboard (temperature, power consumption, memory usage)
- Bot detection and filtering
- Statistics visualization with interactive charts

## Tech Stack (Current Site Implementation)

- **Runtime**: Deno 1.x with TypeScript support
- **Framework**: Fresh 1.7.3 (full-stack web framework with SSR and islands architecture)
- **UI Library**: Preact 10.22.0 (React-compatible, lightweight)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.4.1 (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Database**: ClickHouse for analytics and redirect tracking
- **Charts**: ECharts for interactive data visualizations
- **Storage**: Deno KV for queue management and temporary data
- **Deployment**: Deno Deploy (serverless edge runtime)

### Deno-Specific Features Used
- **Fresh Islands**: Client-side interactivity with EChart.tsx components
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic route generation from file structure
- **Import Maps**: Modern dependency management without package.json
- **Built-in TypeScript**: No build step required for TS compilation
- **Web Standards**: Native fetch, Web APIs, ES modules
- **Deno KV**: Built-in key-value store for queue processing
- **Permission System**: Granular security with --allow flags

### Performance Optimizations
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fast initial page loads
- **Edge Computing**: Global distribution via Deno Deploy
- **Static Assets**: Optimized serving of CSS, images, and favicons
- **Minimal Bundle**: Preact's small footprint vs React

## Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```bash
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
